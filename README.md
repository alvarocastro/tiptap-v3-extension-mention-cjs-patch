# @tiptap/extension-mention

### This is a patched version of @tiptap/extension-mention to work when importing the CommonJS compiled files.

Seems that the original extension is not compiling ok for CommonJS and gives errors when trying to use it, the bug was reported more than a month ago, I'm creating this patched version as a workaround until the bug is fixed.
